  "input": "Consider the following statements P. The Anti-Defection Law bans an elected member from voting against the explicit mandate of his/her party. Q. The Anti-Defection provisions do not apply if one-third of the members of a party disobey the mandate of the party and constitute themselves as a separate party. Which of the statement(s) given above is/are correct?",
  "options": {
    "A": "Only P",
    "B": "Only Q",
    "C": "Both P and Q",
    "D": "Neither P nor Q"
  },
  "choices": [
    "A",
    "B",
    "C",
    "D"
  ],
  "answer": "A",
  "explanation": "The grounds for disqualification under the Anti-Defection Law are as follows: If he votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction issued by his political party or anyone authorised to do so, without obtaining prior permission. As a pre- condition for his disqualification, his abstention from voting should not be condoned by his party or the authorised person within 15 days of such incident. As per the 1985 Act, a ‘defection’ by one-third of the elected members of a political party was considered a ‘merger’. Finally, the 91st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003, changed this. So now at least two-thirds of the members of a party have to be in favour of a “merger” for it to have validity in the eyes of the law."
