  },
  "choices": [

  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "After a Bill has been passed by both Houses, it is presented to the President for his assent. The President can assent or withhold his assent to a Bill or he can return a Bill, other than a Money Bill, for reconsideration. If the Bill is again passed by the Houses, with or without amendment made by the President, he shall not withhold assent there from. But, when a Bill amending the Constitution passed by each House with the requisite majority is presented to the President, he shall give his assent thereto. A Bill becomes an Act of Parliament after being passed by both the Houses of Parliament and assented to by the President."
