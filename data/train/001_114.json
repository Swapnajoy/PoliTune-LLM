  "explanation": "First amendment made in 1951, inserted two new articles, 31A and 31B and the 9th schedule to give protection from challenge to land reforms. It formed the subject-matter of dilatory litigation, as a result of which the implementation of these important measures, affecting large numbers of people, had been held up. Accordingly, a new article 31A was introduced with retrospective effect to uphold such measures. Further, another new article 31B was introduced to validate 13 enactments relating to zamindari abolition."
