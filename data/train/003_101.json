  },
  "choices": [
    "A",
    "B",
    "C",
    "D"
  ],
  "answer": "D",
  "explanation": "The Constitution empowers Parliament of India to make laws on the matters reserved for States (States List). However, this can only be done if Rajya Sabha first passes a resolution by two-thirds supermajority granting such a power to the Union Parliament. The union government cannot make a law on a matter reserved for states without an authorisation from Rajya Sabha.So the House of People does not have special powers with respect to the state list."
